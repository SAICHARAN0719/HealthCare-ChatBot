ðŸ“š Overview

In today's fast-paced world, chatbots are revolutionizing customer service across various industries. Whether it's answering questions, providing support, or even making recommendations, chatbots use artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with users.

In the healthcare industry, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. Hospitals, clinics, and private healthcare providers use these bots to engage with patients online, helping them find the right specialists, book appointments, and get access to the correct treatments. With this Health Care Chat-Bot, we aim to extend these benefits by providing an AI-powered assistant that can guide you to the right diagnosis and recommend doctors based on your symptoms.

By leveraging machine learning and a decision tree classifier, the bot simulates the role of a general physician, helping users understand what might be wrong with them based on their symptoms.
ðŸ’¡ Key Features

    Registration & Login System: Secure user authentication with a simple sign-up and login process.
    Chatbot Interface: A GUI-based chatbot that interacts with users, asking questions about symptoms to diagnose potential health conditions.
    Disease Diagnosis: The bot uses a machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier) to predict possible diseases based on user responses.
    Doctor Recommendations: Once a disease is diagnosed, the bot recommends an appropriate doctor and provides clickable links to their profiles.
    24/7 Healthcare Support: The chatbot works around the clock, offering support whenever needed.

This project relies on several Python modules to function correctly:

    tkinter - For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
    os - To interact with the operating system and handle files.
    webbrowser - For opening links to doctor profiles and other external websites.
    numpy - For numerical computations.
    pandas - For handling and manipulating data.
    matplotlib - For data visualization (though it might not be used in the current version, it's included in case you want to visualize some data).
